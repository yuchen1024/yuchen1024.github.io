<h2>Course Description</h2>
    <p>
    This course is a graduate-level, intensive class of public-key cryptography.  
    The emphasis is on essential concepts, precise models and definitions, and proof techniques. 
    We will introduce a variety of advanced primitives/tools, 
    and then demonstrate their powerful applications in building PKE in a generic manner. 
    </p>  

    <p>
    Here is a list of topics that we would like to cover. 
    (The syllabus can be found here as well.) 
    Please feel free to contact me if you have questions about the course.
    </p>

<ul>
<li> Introduction (background of PKE)
<li> NIZK (Naor-Yung/Dolev-Dwork-Naor/Sahai paradigm)
<li> Advanced Trapdoor Functions (lossy/correlated-product/adaptive TDFs)
<li> Hash Proof System
<li> Extractable Hash Proof System 
<li> Program Obfuscation
<li> Publicly Evaluable Pseudorandom Functions
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
This course is mathematically rigorous, hence the main prerequisite is mathematical maturity. 
Specifically, students should be comfortable with security proofs and familiar with basic cryptographic notions. 
Helpful prior courses are:
<ul>
<li> Theoretical Foundations of Cryptography
<li> Cryptographic Protocols
</ul>

<hr>


<h2>Supplementary/Must Readings</h2>
<ul>
<li> All the references listed in the 
        <a href="course-info.pdf">Course-Info</a><br> 
<li> <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/cycosmic/posts">我的知乎</a> (for fun)<br>
</ul>

<h2>Grading</h2>
(100%) Reading report: Please pick your favorite papers published on (STOC/FOCS/Crypto/Eurocrypt/Asiacrypt/TCC/PKC), 
whose category is preferably public-key cryptography/protocols/foundations of cryptography. 
Study it as hard as you can, then write your own thinking. 
No matter how naive or trivial it might be, just write down your reflections.
<ul>
<li>The reading report will be judged by its quality, not its length. Please keep it succinct.
<li>Report must be typeset in LATEX and submitted in one PDF file. 
    The PDF file should begins with a title page which lists your name, student id, supervisor and affiliation, 
    then followed by your reading report.
<li>Please email your work to <a href="huangguifang@iie.ac.cn">huangguifang@iie.ac.cn</a> 
    before 2019.07.14 with subject of the following format: id-name
<li>Warning: submission does not meet the above format requirements runs a risk of being degrading!
</ul>
